## Hackathon Project Workspace Submission Instructions

Each team should assign an engineer to take the necessary steps to provision the team's project repository in the Discover Enterprise GitHub environment. 

To ensure a smooth development and submission process for your project, it is important to understand how to provision your Enterprise GitHub repository using your Team Workspace repo in public GitHub. 

### Identify Workstations

1. Determine which computer will be used as the **Development Workstation**. This needs to be a *personal computer* that is not connected to the Discover VPN.
2. Determine which computer will be used as the **Discover Workstation**. This needs to be a Discover provided computer that is connected to the Discover VPN.

### Create Submission Repository

1. Using a [Discover Enterprise GitHub account](https://github.discoverfinancial.com/), create a new `Team Project Submission Repository` using the following naming convention:

    ```
    trucreds-<team-project-name>
    ```

2. Follow the instructions for adding [GitHub Topics](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics#adding-topics-to-your-repository) so that you can **ADD** the REQUIRED `runway-t22-3` topic to the Team's Project Submission Repository. 
3. Clone this new `Team Project Submission Repository` to the filesystem of the Discover Workstation
4. Navigate to the `Team Workspace Repository`on public GitHub.
5. Clone the `Team Workspace Repository` to the filesystem on the Discover Workstation
7. Update the local `Team Project Submission Repository` with the contents of the local `Team Workspace Repository`.
8. Publish (*push*) changes to the remote `Team Project Submission Repository`.

# DFS TruCreds Hackathon -  Project Submission Template

## Purpose
This repository is a [GitHub Repo Template][1] for creating a project workspace respository for use by a hackathon team. This repository serves as a templatized tutorial for creating an end-to-end demonstration for digital trust use cases associated with the interactions of stakeholders (Issuer, Holder, Verifier) in the [Verifiable Credentials Trust Triangle][2].

## Motivation
The *Innovation Accelerator Team* within Discover Financial Services developed this repository as an education tool for developers and a bootstrap mechanism for participants in Discover's TruCreds Hackathon (circa: 3Q 2022).

## Usage

### 2. Project Development

### 3. Project Submission
Follow these [submission instructions](./submission-guides/submission-instructions.md) prior to finalizing the team's project submission.
